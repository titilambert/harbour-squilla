Presentation of HeySms
======================

I made a small application to send and receive sms on your computer without a specific software.
You just have to use your instant messaging client ... Which have to be compatible with Bonjour protocol.

I made this application because my girlfriend send me a lot of sms when I'm working ...
Now I can answer her without taking my N900 ...
